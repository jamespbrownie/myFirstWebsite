Went to Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs NY. My love of bicycles and the outdoors grew there. Got a compost-bicycle job (???) in Austin, TX so I moved there after graduation. Spent 6 years riding bikes and vibing in Austin, made a lot of good friends and memories along the way, and then realized I actually need to learn a marketable skill. Enrolled in the Flatiron School, and here I am! </p>
